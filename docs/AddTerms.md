# Description
This function is used to add terms one by one to a variable `Sum`. It takes 3
arguments. First is the polynomial of the new term, second is the coefficient of
the new term and last is the sum of all previous terms. This programs only
function is to handle the different array size of the new polynomial and the sum
because they are incompatible and cannot be added.
It is not intended to be called directly and should only be called by the parent
program which computes the polynomial interpolation completely.
